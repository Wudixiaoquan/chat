Scammers make use of this facial data, combined with ID documents and the ability to intercept SMS, to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s banking account. The scammers distribute this malware via TestFlight, Apple’s mobile application testing platform, or social engineer potential victims to install a Mobile Device Management Profile (MDM) which would allow the scammer complete control over the victim’s device and access to the victim’s banking account for unauthorized banking transactions.

Malware consumes data and changes to your data usage could be a sign. Unfamiliar apps or app permissions. Malware may install new apps, disguise themselves as new apps, or enable more permissions than necessary. Slow device performance or overheating. All apps use system resources, but a slower and hotter device could be a sign of malware. Strange behavior, such as calls or messages you didn't make.

Never sideload apps from third-party websites, emails, SMSes, or social media. Be wary of MDM profiles and TestFlight application installations from unknown parties. Pay attention to the permissions an app asks for and use a reputable mobile security software.

Apply a healthy dose of scepticism if you read any news articles that are sensational and discern if the articles come from a credible source. Protect Your Information Secure your device with a strong password, PIN or a relevant mechanism to prevent unauthorised use.TIP: A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and contains a mix of letters, numbers or symbols.

Be cautious when you come across promotional offers that sound too good to be true. Apply a healthy dose of scepticism if you read any news articles that are sensational and discern if the articles come from a credible source. Protect Your Information Secure your device with a strong password, PIN or a relevant mechanism to prevent unauthorised use.TIP: A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and contains a mix of letters, numbers or symbols. You can use this on top of your device’s biometric security feature (if available). Never disclose your digibank User ID, PIN & One-Time Password (OTP) to anyone. DBS will never request for your PIN, password or OTP. Avoid providing your account details (such as passwords and PIN) to third-party financial aggregator applications as these applications may not be secure. Avoid registering other people’s biometrics such as facial or fingerprint registration on your devices if you use biometrics to access DBS applications. Use a different PIN or password for web-based services such as email, online shopping or subscription services. &nbsp",
